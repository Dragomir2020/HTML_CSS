            <h2>Our Mission and Vision </h2>
            <p>IMS is internationally recognized as the leader in predictive analytics and industrial big data modeling for life cycle performance of industrial systems.  As the world pre-eminent NSF Industry/Univerity Cooperative Research Center, IMS is often the first to introduce new concepts and technologies to the research and industry communities.  It is also a leader in the discovery of new methods to assess machine degradation and predict the health of industrial systems including e-manufacturing, e-maintenance, cyber machine systems, cloud-based machine monitoring and manufacturing, intelligent cyber machine systems, etc. These discoveries translate into a useful methodology and tools for the development and deployment of prognostics and health management of industrial systems. </p>
            <p>The Center envisions the future of maintenance as a system that enables equipment to achieve and sustain near-zero breakdown performance with self-maintenance capabilities (self-aware, self-predict, self-compare, and self-configure), and ultimately to realize the autonomous transformation of raw data to useful information for improved reliability, productivity, and asset utilization. </p>
            <p>IMS is focused on frontier technologies in predictive analytics including prognostics and health management technologies, cyber physical systems, industrial big data analytics, and intelligent decision support tools. The center has coined the trademarked Watchdog AgentÂ® prognostics tools and Device-to-Business (D2B) predictronics platform for e-maintenance applications.</p>
